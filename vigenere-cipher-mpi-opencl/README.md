# Vigenère Cipher - MPI & OpenCL

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It is a form of polyalphabetic substitution ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)).

## Implementation Details

1. **MPI Implementation (C++)**
   - Implemented using the **Message Passing Interface (MPI)** in C++.
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was not used in this implementation.

2. **OpenCL Implementation**
   - Implemented using the **OpenCL framework** on a **NVIDIA GTX 1050**.
   - Utilizes the **NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit** for efficient processing.
