# Ecotourism Website Project

This project is a website designed for a company specializing in ecotourism.  
**NOTE:** The project is still in draft format, with only the basic structure changes implemented.

## What is Ecotourism?
Ecotourism is a form of sustainable tourism focused on visiting fragile, pristine, and undisturbed natural areas. It aims to minimize environmental impact and serves as a low-impact, small-scale alternative to mass tourism. 

The focus is on destinations where local flora, fauna, and cultural heritage are the primary attractions. Ecotourism offers visitors insight into human impact on the environment, fostering greater appreciation of natural habitats.

## Features

### User Accounts & Reservations
Users can create accounts and book trips to exotic destinations across Central and South America, including:
- Brazil
- Bolivia
- Costa Rica
- Venezuela

### Trip Guides
Trips are managed by professional guides employed by the company. These guides:
- Plan itineraries in advance (places to visit, accommodations, attractions, costs, dates, etc.)
- Post trip details on the website as announcements, complete with maps, photos, and other relevant information
- Respond to user inquiries and questions through comments on their trip pages

Each trip typically has multiple guides to ensure a comprehensive and well-organized experience.

### Announcements & Trip Details
Each trip announcement will include:
- Pictures
- A detailed map with routes
- Important information on destinations, activities, and logistics

### Feedback & Reviews
After completing a trip, users can leave feedback and share their experiences through comments, helping others gain insights into the tours and destinations.
