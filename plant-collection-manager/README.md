One of my first programming projects back in college, written in the C language, making use of input and output files.
It is handling simple records that represent decorative plants.

The elements of a record are :
1. plant genera name 
2. plant species name 
3. minimum temperature resistance during winter

It offers functions for adding a new entry, deleting an already existing one or sorting by some criteria the records.
